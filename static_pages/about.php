		       	<p>Date Shruti is brought to you by the makers of <a href="http://www.datejamie.com" target="_blank">Date Jamie</a>. We really loved making Date Jamie, so we decided to do it again. Mostly because we love Shruti, but also because making cool digital experiences is what we love to do. Yes, even in our free time. #InternetNerdAlert</p>

				<p>Do we do this a lot? Nope. There’s a high level of service and personalization that goes into these sites and we like it that way. We also happen to have full time jobs.  </p>

				<p>That said, if you are really, intensely interested in having your own Date Diana or Date Doyle, we’d be happy to talk to you about it. You must reside in the NYC area. </p>

				<p><span>But, guys, this is a great idea! Why don’t you make it into a self-service platform?</span>  We’ve heard this a lot. Honestly, we would sooner drown a kitten before we turned this into a plug-and-play, impersonal dating engine. The whole point is to provide the service and the outside perspective that those other dating sites sorely lack. No one, in our opinion, should have to create their own dating profile. It’s too much pressure and it’s just really hard to translate who you are on the inside to the rest of the world. That’s why we think the magic of our dating site process is the element of friends. The part of dating that sucks, like trying to describe yourself, friends are more than willing to do. This leaves the fun parts of dating – like eating and kissing and talking all night – to you.</p>
